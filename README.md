# Tympan Rev E Hardware Light
Repository for Tympan Rev E Light Electronics and case designs. This version of the Rev E is based on the Teensy 4.1 by PJRC and incorporates the Teensy 4.1 into our own design, as we did with the Tympan Rev D. This version is light in that it does not contain an on-board AIC, and is meant to be a PCB bridge between the Teensy 4.1 and the AIC Shield.

This is a work in progress.
